The crypto module uses I2C to receive communication from the main board. The main board will send the crypto board an
OP enum value sepcifying the operation that is required and then it will send the necesary data back to the crypto 
board. Once the crypto board completes the crypto operation it will use the I2C protocol to send the information back
to the main board.
